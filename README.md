Overview of the Project
This project aims to design and develop a front-end responsive website using HTML, CSS, Javascript and modern web development techniques. It would be a website about my own portfolio such as my skills and to showcase my coding skills by making the website attractive with animations and pictures and icons to build my website and make it look professional. The website is also to show my "employee" that with the skills i have, i would be a great employee to their companies.

Design Process
I get inspirations from videos about css, html and javascript to then create their own website and really professional looking. By doing portfolio website, i can also learn how to create my own personal website and in the future it would be useful to me if i were to build my own company and start ups.

Theme
Purple colours was used for menu options and icons as i feel that is it nice-looking

User Stories
As an individual, i was always amazed and curious about how websites were created and the animations which was with it and how to even code. Also, the tools that was used to create website also amazed me. By using all these tools and using the languages to code a website i have always wanted to try it myself.

In the future i want to start my own company and IT related even though i do not know specifically what kind of roles my companies would play. Moreover, i would definitely want my comapany to help the world outside and not doing illegal stuff that will harm the world or the environment.


Features
-I focussed on my website on animations where user hover certain elements to see how the aniamtions done. Elements such as menu options and some important headers or icons would glow or underneath there will be a line appearing and disappear when not hovering it. 
-My website also include responsive layouts where my items would not be in a messed when using different devices as the screen other smaller in size, which will increase user experience when using my website.
